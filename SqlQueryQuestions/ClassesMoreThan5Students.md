### [Question](#question)

Table: Courses
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```
- **(student, class)** is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.
 

Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

#### Example 1:

Input: 

Courses table:
```
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
```
Output: 
```
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
```
Explanation: 
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.

### [Solution](#solution)

Hereâ€™s the solution to find all classes that have at least five students:

---

#### SQL Solution
```sql
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
```

---

#### Explanation
1. **Group By**:  
   - The `GROUP BY class` clause groups all rows in the `Courses` table by the `class` column.

2. **Count**:  
   - The `COUNT(student)` function counts the number of students in each class.

3. **Having Clause**:  
   - The `HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5` filters the groups to only include those with at least 5 students.

---

#### Output for the Given Input
**Courses Table**:
```
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
```

**Query Result**:
```
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
```

In this example, only `Math` has 6 students, which is greater than or equal to 5, so it's the only class included in the result.
