### [Question](#question)

Table: Employee
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```
- **id** is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
- If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
- No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

#### Example 1:

Input: 

Employee table:
```
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
```
Output: 
```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+
```

### [Solution](#solution)

Hereâ€™s how you can solve the problem using a `JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT 
    m.name AS name
FROM 
    Employee m
JOIN 
    Employee e
ON 
    m.id = e.managerId
GROUP BY 
    m.id, m.name
HAVING 
    COUNT(e.id) >= 5;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`JOIN` Clause**:
   - The `JOIN` connects the `Employee` table to itself.
   - `m` represents the manager, and `e` represents the employees who report to that manager.
   - `m.id = e.managerId` ensures we are associating employees with their managers.

2. **`GROUP BY` Clause**:
   - We group the records by `m.id` and `m.name` to count the number of employees (`e.id`) reporting to each manager.

3. **`HAVING` Clause**:
   - Filters the results to include only those managers who have at
